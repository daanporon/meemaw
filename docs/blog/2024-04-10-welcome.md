## Why did we start working on Meemaw?

We actually pivoted from another project where we decided to implement our own wallet system. The existing alternatives were all proprietary solutions with unclear specifications. Also, we could not find one with proper cover for all platforms, a true trustless architecture and support for third party Auth providers. So we decided to build it ourselves.
