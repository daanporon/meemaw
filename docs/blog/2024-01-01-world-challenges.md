More than ever, we are facing massive challenges as a civilisation. We will need to innovate on multiple fronts and be incredibly focused to stand a chance. Some of those challenges, we believe, could use some help from what we consider are the main benefits from cryptographic and blockchain systems: trust, accountability, transparency and verifiability.

Here are the main causes that get us out of bed every morning :

üî• **Global Warming:** The major crisis facing our generation. We know what we need to do, we just don't do it. We need stronger accountability and trust. We need transparency and verifiability. Here are a few examples where it would improve our chances: more transparent tracking of recycling, goods supply chain and carbon offset; better incentives for individuals and companies; more transparency in NGOs operations.

üí™ **Health:** Advances in tech, including AI, are on their way to unlock healthier lives for all of us. However, how do we manage trust and transparency over the use of our medical data? This will most probably be the main challenge to be solved for those new technologies to be adopted, and we bet Web3 can help.

üß¨ **Scientific Research:** Research is the source of progress. It's the key for reducing global warming and improving health. However, the publishing industry is not ideal. Incentives are completely skewed, trust is low and results are rarely reproducible. How much faster would progress be if we could improve incentives, trust and verifiability in research?

üè¶ **Personal Finance:** Not everyone lives in so-called developed countries. Many people still struggle with personal finance. Many people are still unbanked. Web3 is becoming the new avenue for many people in some parts of Africa and South America to manage their financial belongings. How can we help make it easier for them?

## Ok, how do we do it ?

Obviously, this project is not going to solve it all. However, we strongly believe that if Web3 gets mainstream enough, new solutions will emerge. We need to enable entrepreneurs and businesses to onboard new people to Web3, securely and smoothly, and we need to do it at scale. 

We are building solutions to make it easier and more secure for developers to onboard new people to Web3, at scale. We will continue to improve our offering so that your experience gets even better and more complete. We want to enable as many projects as possible.

### üéÅ Open source

CHANGE, there is another blog post about that. Potentially link to it?

This is why [Meemaw is open source](https://www.github.com/getmeemaw/meemaw). Everyone should be able to deploy and go. Everyone should be able to verify and audit the key technologies they use in their project. Everyone should be able to contribute to the larger community and improve our common future. 

**If we're serious about onboarding the next billion users to Web3, we need to be serious about distributing Meemaw to the public, openly and freely, at scale.**

Of course, to unlock the maximum impact, we will eventually need to offer commercial offerings. This will allow people to use Meemaw with less overhead (cloud), allow bigger players (entreprise), as well as sustain Meemaw's operations for the long term. However, the core of Meemaw will always remain fully open-source. Only entreprise features may have a different licence.
