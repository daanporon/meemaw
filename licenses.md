Most of Meemaw is under the ***AGPLv3*** license. Here is what that means in short:
* **if you just want to use Meemaw to provide wallets for your own users, you can use it for free** both for personal and commercial projects. If you want to fork and modify Meemaw with that same objective in mind, we encourage you to share your updates with the community, although it is not required.
* If you want to use Meemaw inside a product that allows your customers to provide wallets to their users, you must contribute back. There are two ways to do so: by sharing your own complete source code with the community, or by buying a commercial license from Meemaw, so that we can invest this money in our product, which benefits the whole community.

We think that the team at Lago nailed it with their blog post on [why they chose AGPLv3](https://www.getlago.com/blog/open-source-licensing-and-why-lago-chose-agplv3), including some more details on what you can and cannot do.

The public librairies of the client SDKs are under the ***Apache 2.0*** license. You can use them freely. They are only wrappers and are made so that they externally link to official Meemaw assets for the core implementation (wasm file for the Web SDK, xcframework for the iOS SDK) which are under *AGPLv3*.

You can find the full license in LICENSE.
